# ðŸ’¬ `quotes`

1. A collection of thought provoking
quotations.

The quotes are contained
in a _single_ file:
[**`quotes.json`**](https://github.com/nelsonic/quotes/blob/master/quotes.json)
so they can be used independently
of any programming language.

<!--
Below are usage examples in
several languages.
-->


2. A module that returns a quote when invoked.
Methods include `random`,


## Why?

We needed a reliable and _fast_ source of quotes.
There are _many_ ways of getting quotes
including several APIs
but we wanted something
that had _zero_ latency
and could (_optionally_) work _offline_
so we _had_ to collate a database.

The `.json` file can be used in _any_ project or programming language.




## What?

# Functions





##Â `Elixir`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `quotes` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:quotes, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/quotes](https://hexdocs.pm/quotes).

## `Node.js`

# Node.js Sample Code:

```js

// Array of quotes with 12 words
const file = "quotes.json";
$.getJSON(file).done(function (json) {
	return json.filter(function (item) {
		return item.text.split(" ").length <= 12;
	});
});

// Array of quotes for author Buddha
const file = "quotes.json";
$.getJSON(filePath).done(function (json) {
	return json.filter(function (item) {
		return item.author === "Buddha";
	});
});
```

### Remove Quotes Where `author` is `null`, `unknown` or `anonymous`

We aren't interested in having quotes from anonymous authors.
Anonymous quotes might as well have been said
by your mate Steve said at the pub;
they have their place, but it's not here.

So we need to _remove_ them from any bulk quote files.
see: `Utils.clean` in
[/lib/utils.ex#L7](https://github.com/nelsonic/quotes/blob/1c0726a8d7cfd14d07f6e58c15ee52beb705fd1b/lib/utils.ex#L7)
